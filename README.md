1. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
- Yes, I would check to see if a message was created and also received. 
   - If the message is created
   - If the recieved message matches the sent message
   - empty messsage (edge case)
   - probably long message (limit?)
2. Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
- Yes, I would check to see if it handles the max-character limit and that the function is working as intended. 
   - max-character length
   - above character length
